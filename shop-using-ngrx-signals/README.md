# Signals Shop - Udemy Course Project

Welcome to the **Signals Shop** project! This project is part of your learning journey in the **NGRX Signal Store** Udemy course.

## Project Overview

The UI for the Signals Shop is ready, and we will add state management features to the application throughout the course. After learning new features of NGRX Signals in each section, we will apply those features to this project. By the end of the course, the application will be fully functional, showcasing the power of NGRX Signals.

The application has an inventory of signal-related "fictional" products. You can search through the inventory and add items to the cart. Then you can modify the quantities of each item in the cart. Finally, you can checkout the cart. The application keeps your cart state stored in the local storage, so you can continue from where you left off.

## How to Use This Project

1. Follow the instructions provided in the course for each section.
2. Implement the state management features as you progress through the lectures.
3. Complete the project step-by-step until it becomes a fully functional shopping application.

## Current Section: NGRX Core Features

In this section, we start with the NGRX core features:

1. Defining the core state and store.
2. Adding derived state (view models).
3. Adding methods using updaters.
4. Adding cart persistency using hooks.

Enjoy building the Signals Shop and applying your new skills!
